Since this is a Java project, you can import it into Eclipse.
You can run the project with the java command:

java -jar AssociationRuleMiner.jar <filename>

where filename is the (full or relative) path of the ARFF file.
NOTE: The ARFF file must have nominalized values ONLY.
Normailzation means to bring the values to scale so that one feature does not outweigh the other
